# Tapadoodledo

Made this app when I first got my iPhone. First app, so feel free to critique / fix up anything that you like. Wanted to go through the process of making an app and getting it on the app store. It got rejected by Apple on the first try (background modes not used, can't record people without their permission, stuff like that. I may try and see if I can update it to be allowed but not right now. So do with it as you please).

## What does it do?

Simply, Tapadoodle do allows you to start your iPhones recorder while it is in your pocket. Start the app, turn listening on, then put it in your pocket. If you tap your phone twice while it is in your pocket it should vibrate and then start recording. Tap/hit it twice again and it should stop.

You can then view the recordings within the app. From my very simple tests, it does not get set off unintentially (sometimes when I threw it onto a couch or something it would activate but ideally you would just turn it one and put it in your pocket.) Works similarly to: http://www.knocktounlock.com/

## WHY?

I saw the Heard App (http://www.heardapp.com/) but I wanted something I had more control over. Sometimes when I am driving and a song comes on I would like to remember it. Now I just tap my phone to record a part of the song and then look it up after. Obviously also useful to do when you get introduced to people to remember names / other info without having to pull out your phone and hitting record.


# Installation

Unfortunately, you will need a developer account to put this on your phone. I will try and see if I can get it on the App store, but not looking likely.

# NOTES

* While listening, it is taking in accelerometer data, so it may drain your battery quick.
* My phone is jailbroken, so hopefully it works on yours  as it does on mine. But if it's not running in the background, let me know.
